            <p>As explained in the previous pages, most of the game is built off of its community. Beatmaps are created by players, they're ranked by players, which leads them to be downloaded and played by more players. There's also players who speciliaze in making osu! skins, so it looks like something that a certain player or players like to see. Players is an umbrella term for three of the categories, as in the community they're called something else. Beatmap creators are called mappers, map rankers are called modders, and skin creators are called skinners. For the most part though, everyone who registers usually make beatmaps or play the game.  </p>
