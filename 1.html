            <p>osu!, like most games, has a ranking system. This makes way for people who play the game competitively and want to be well known among the osu! community, whether they're ranked #1 in the world or in their country.The different game modes have different leaderboards. This is to show who is the "best" in each gamemode. More on the four different gamemodes will be talked about on the <a href="3.html">Different Play Styles</a> page.</p>
						<p>The game's beatmaps, which is what they're called </p>
						<p>How the players are ranked is dependent on how much performance points, or "pp" for short. The higher PP a player has, the higher they're ranked.</p>
						<p>osu! gameplay by Mario. very cool man, thanks</p>
